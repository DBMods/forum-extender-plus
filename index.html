        <h1>
<a name="forum-mod-icons" class="anchor" href="#forum-mod-icons"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>forum-mod-icons</h1>

<p>Adds a Nyan Cat icon to the forum Super Users complete with animation, and tweaks many other aspects of the forums</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-install" class="anchor" href="#how-to-install"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Install</h2>

<p>To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file of your choice as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other. Alternately, you can copy and paste the source or use the RAW link to the file.</p>

<h2>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<h3>
<a name="closed-thread-alerts" class="anchor" href="#closed-thread-alerts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Closed Thread Alerts</h3>

<p>Some themes hide closed notifications by default. Now, no matter the theme, closed threads will be indicated as such on the front page.</p>

<h3>
<a name="super-user-icons" class="anchor" href="#super-user-icons"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Super User Icons</h3>

<p>Super Users, even when also Pro users, don't get icons by default. Fixed! You can now choose between tons of icons for the Super Users.</p>

<h3>
<a name="thread-highlighting" class="anchor" href="#thread-highlighting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thread Highlighting</h3>

<p>Threads on forum pages and the front page are automatically highlighted based on post count. Green for new threads, yellow for one response, and red for two.</p>

<h3>
<a name="sticky-build-thread-updating" class="anchor" href="#sticky-build-thread-updating"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sticky Build Thread Updating</h3>

<p>If you're following a stable or experimental build thread, the script will detect when it's no longer sticky, and automatically find the newest one for you.</p>

<h3>
<a name="super-user-post-highlighting" class="anchor" href="#super-user-post-highlighting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Super User Post Highlighting</h3>

<p>Super Users offer in-depth information and solutions. Their posts are highlighted in gold on threads. There's also built-in throttling to disable them if they exceed a certain percentage of posts (to avoid an entirely gold page).</p>

<h3>
<a name="forum-regular-highlighting" class="anchor" href="#forum-regular-highlighting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Forum Regular Highlighting</h3>

<p>Forum regulars besides the Super Users are often on the forums as well, and provide useful information as well. Their posts are automatically highlighted in green.</p>

<h3>
<a name="post-title-hiding" class="anchor" href="#post-title-hiding"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Post Title Hiding</h3>

<p>Let's face it. The post title box just gets in the way, and only does anything if you create a new thread. It will automatically be disabled unless you're creating a new thread.</p>

<h3>
<a name="dropbox-integration" class="anchor" href="#dropbox-integration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dropbox Integration</h3>

<p>You must be authenticated with Dropbox to use the preferences and post drafting, but they sync to all of your computers via the Dropbox Datastore API.</p>

<h3>
<a name="settings-panel" class="anchor" href="#settings-panel"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Settings Panel</h3>

<p>The script includes a settings panel, where you can customize settings without having to manually edit the script.</p>

<h4>
<a name="themes" class="anchor" href="#themes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Themes</h4>

<p>Here, we give you the ability to switch between the current theme, or additional themes, representing old, deprecated layouts and custom options.</p>

<h4>
<a name="collapsible-footer" class="anchor" href="#collapsible-footer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collapsible Footer</h4>

<p>The footer of the page, especially on longer pages, just adds more length to the page. When collapsed, the footer can be easily expanded, but doesn't take up as much screen real estate when not in use.</p>

<h4>
<a name="automatic-page-reloading" class="anchor" href="#automatic-page-reloading"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatic Page Reloading</h4>

<p>As opposed to using a separate script to automatically reload pages, or just doing it manually, you can have forum pages, the front page, and stickies all reload automatically, and all with independent delays.</p>

<h3>
<a name="navigation-bar" class="anchor" href="#navigation-bar"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Navigation Bar</h3>

<p>There's also an included navigation bar that organizes stuff that's added to the page.</p>

<h4>
<a name="super-user-activity-list" class="anchor" href="#super-user-activity-list"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Super User Activity List</h4>

<p>The Super Users are the sole representatives of the Dropbox team. Knowing almost everything there is to know about it, they frequent the forums. This activity list adds a collapsible list of latest activity from all of the Super Users.</p>

<h4>
<a name="post-snippets" class="anchor" href="#post-snippets"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Post Snippets</h4>

<p>Many forum regulars have a set list of text snippets for the forums. A built-in list of snippets are enabled on threads and edit pages for easy access to these.</p>

<h4>
<a name="post-drafting" class="anchor" href="#post-drafting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Post Drafting</h4>

<p>The script now allows for drafts of posts. If you want to save a draft, click the button, and it's done. The same thing goes for restoring a previous draft. Drafts are also thread-specific, so you can save drafts for any number of threads at a time.</p>
