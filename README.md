#Dropbox Forum Extender+
Beefs up forum functionality, and makes it much easier to use

##How to Install
To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file of your choice as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the source or use the RAW link to the file.

##Features
###Post Quoting
If you need to quote someone on something, it's made easy to quote part of a post, or the whole post, and automatically get author information.

###Easy post markup links
The forums allow a bit of HTML markup. Adding this markup is now easier than ever with things like lists or links.

###Closed Thread Alerts
Some bbPress themes hide closed notifications by default. Now, no matter the theme, closed threads will be indicated as such on the front page.

###Super User Icons
Super Users, even when also Pro users, don't get icons by default. Fixed! You can now choose between tons of icons for the Super Users.

###Thread Highlighting
Threads on forum pages and the front page are automatically highlighted based on post count. Green for new threads, yellow for one response, and red for two.

###Sticky Build Thread Updating
If you're following a stable or experimental build thread, the script will detect when it's no longer sticky, and automatically find the newest one for you.

###Super User Post Highlighting
Super Users, knowing what they do, are able to offer in-depth information and solutions. Their posts are highlighted in gold on threads. There's also built-in throttling to disable them if they exceed a certain percentage of posts (to avoid an entirely gold page).

###Forum Regular Highlighting
Forum regulars besides the Super Users are often on the forums as well, and provide useful information. Their posts are automatically highlighted in green.

###Post Title Hiding
Let's face it. The post title box just gets in the way, and only does anything if you create a new thread. Now, unless you're creating a new thread, it's automatically hidden.

###Dropbox API Integration
You must be authenticated with Dropbox to use the preferences and post drafting, but they sync to all of your computers via the Dropbox Datastore API.

###Settings Panel
The script includes a settings panel, where you can customize settings without having to manually edit the script.

####Themes
Here, we give you the ability to switch between the current theme, or additional themes, representing old, deprecated layouts and custom options.

####Collapsible Footer
The footer of the page, especially on longer pages, just adds more length to the page. When collapsed, the footer can be easily expanded, but doesn't take up as much screen real estate when not in use.

####Automatic Page Reloading
As opposed to using a separate script to automatically reload pages, or just doing it manually, you can have forum pages, the front page, and stickies all reload automatically, and all with independent delays.

###Navigation Bar
There's also an included navigation bar that organizes stuff that's added to the page.

####Super User Activity List
The Super Users are the sole representatives of the Dropbox team. Knowing almost everything there is to know about it, they frequent the forums. This activity list adds a collapsible list of latest activity from all of the Super Users.

####Post Snippets
Many forum regulars have a set list of text snippets for the forums. A built-in list of snippets are enabled on threads and edit pages for easy access to these.

####Post Drafting
The script now allows for drafts of posts. If you want to save a draft, click the button, and it's done. The same thing goes for restoring a previous draft. Drafts are also thread-specific, so you can save drafts for any number of threads at a time.
