#Dropbox Forum Extender+
Beefs up forum functionality, and makes it much easier to use

##How to Install
To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the source or use the RAW link to the file.

##Features

###Easy post tools
The built in markup options for posts are pretty extensive. However, we've enhanced the existing tools to bring you much more functionality.

####Standard markup
Adding markup is now easier than ever with one click links for things like lists or links.

####Post drafting
If you're writing a fairly extensive post, and you want to save your progress, or pick up where you left off later, you can save drafts. This allows you to save a snapshot of the content of the post form and later update the draft, or restore from it on a per thread basis. This means you can have up to one drafted post at a time per thread on the forums.

####Post snippets
For more commonly used responses or links, such as explanations of a feature, or a list of things to accomplish a task with Dropbox, it can be tedious to type out a response that's nearly the same every time. We've added the ability to create predefined snippets, similar to those of a text expansion utility. These snippets can be loaded into the form wherever your cursor currently lies with the click of a button. These snippets can also be added, edited, or deleted at any time from the snippet manager.

####Post quoting
The current forum post forms offer markup options to make formatting your post easier. In addition to these built in tools, you can now quote users' posts directly, both as a whole post, or just a selection of text with a simple click.

####Help Center quick linking
If you frequent the forums, you may eventually memorize some of the Help Center numbers. For example, article 175 will give you a rundown of Selective Sync. To save time when linking to these articles, referencing an article can be done via an @ notation (ex: @175). The script will convert all of these notations into clickable links on the fly when the post is submitted.

Additionally, the @ notation introduces an autocomplete list. If you don't remember the number exactly, a list of all articles matching what's currently typed will pop up, allowing you to select the proper option.

###Thread highlighting
With the ever growing list of threads on the forums, for regulars, it can sometimes be hard to quickly go through and answer help threads. Through the use of highlighting, you can now quickly scan to see which threads need response. Fresh threads show highlighted in green, while one or two replies are gold or red respectively.

###Preferences menu
With all of the customization the script has to offer, there should be a central place to manage it. The preferences menu allows for easy customization of almost everything without having to manually edit any code.

####Snippet manager
Within the preferences menu, you have quick access to the snippet manager, which allows you to customize your list of snippets used for text expansion.

####Page reloading
For those that frequent the forums, the script has a built in mechanism for automatically handling timed refreshing of forum pages at a user-defined interval. This ensures that whenever you go back to a list of threads, you always have a list of the most recent threads in front of you.

###Messaging system
Most forum platforms offer a messaging backend to talk with other users. The messaging system here provides a simple, yet elegant way of privately talking with other users of the userscript without the need to post anything publicly.

###Navigation bar
The navigation bar fixed to the bottom of the screen provides a quick and simple way to access common tools such as the messaging system or preferences. Use this to quickly open other parts and features of the script.

###Dropbox API integration
The script integrates with the Dropbox API, meaning everything you do goes with you. This means that every computer you link to the userscript will share the same copy of your preferences, snippets, and drafts, preventing you from having to reconfigure them every time you link a new userscript.
