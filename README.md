#forum-mod-icons
Adds a Nyan Cat icon to the forum Super Users complete with animation.

##How to Install
To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other plugin. Alternately, you can copy and paste the source instead of downloading the ZIP.

##How It Works
The plugin checks all elements on the page against the threadauthor class, and on those elements, it goes deeper into the structure and changes and adds the required elements to the page.
