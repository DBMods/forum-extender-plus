##Script Variations
There are three separate variations of the script, all with varied stability and features.

###Stable Builds
The stable build is, as the name implies, fully stable, and shouldn't cause any major issues.

###Beta Builds
The beta build, labeled as "beta_included," include newer code and features that may not be in the stable line and are mostly stable, but may cause some occasioanl issues, which are to be expected. The beta line also keeps up-to-date with the stable line, so any stable releases in between beta stuff will cause both the stable and beta builds to use the same code.

###Nightlies
Nightlies are the most bleeding-edge of the three, but also the most unstable. Nightlies are typically released as soon as the feature is developed, occasionally before debugging. Nightlies are all independent, and will not update to each other. The only updates to an installed nightly that may occur are things like very small patches or changes. If you want the latest nighlies, you'll have to manually install the new ones.

##How to Install
To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file of your choice as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other. Alternately, you can copy and paste the source or use the RAW link to the file.
