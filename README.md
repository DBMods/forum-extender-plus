#forum-mod-icons
Adds a Nyan Cat icon to the forum Super Users complete with animation, and tweaks many other aspects of the forums

##How to Install
To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file of your choice as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other. Alternately, you can copy and paste the source or use the RAW link to the file.

##Features
###Themes
Here, we give you the ability to switch between the current theme, or additional themes, representing old, deprecated layouts and custom options.

###Settings Panel
The script includes a settings panel, where you can customize settings without having to manually edit the script.

###Collapsible Footer
The footer of the page, especially on longer pages, just adds more length to the page. When collapsed, the footer can be easily explanded, but doesn't take up as much screen real estate when not in use.

###Super User Activity List
The Super Users are the sole representatives of the Dropbxo team. Knowing almost everything there is to know about it, they frequent the forums. This activity list adds a collapsible list of latest activity from all of the Super Users.

###Post Snippets (Nightlies Only)
Many forum regulars have a set list of text snippets for the forums. A built-in list of snippets are enabled on threads and edit pages for easy access to these.

###Super User Post Highlighting
Super Users offer in-depth information and solutions. Their posts are highlighted in gold on threads. There's also built-in throttling to disable them if they exceeed a certain percentage of posts (to avoid an entirely gold page).

###Forum Regular Highlighting
Forum regulars besides the Super Users are often on the forums as well, and provide useful information as well. Their posts are automatically highlighted in green.

###Post Title Hiding
Let's face it. The post title box just gets in the way, and only does anything if you create a new thread. It will automatically be disabled unless you're creating a new thread.

###Post Drafting
The script now allows for drafts of posts. If you want to save a draft, click the button, and it's done. The same thing goes for restoring a previous draft. Drafts are also thread-specific, so you can save drafts for any number of threads at a time.

###Automatic Page Reloading
As opposed to using a separate script to automatically reload pages, or just doing it manually, you can have forum pages, the front page, and stickies all reload automatically, and all with independent delays.

###Super User Icons
Super Users, even when also Pro users, don't get icons. Fixed!

###Thread Highlighting
Threads on forum pages and the front page are automatically highlighted based on post count. Green for new threads, yellow for one response, and red for two.
