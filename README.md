#forum-mod-icons
Adds a Nyan Cat icon to the forum Super Users complete with animation.

##How to Install
To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other plugin. Alternately, you can copy and paste the source instead of downloading the ZIP.

##How It Works
The plugin checks all elements on the page against the threadauthor class, and on those elements, it goes deeper into the structure and changes and adds the required elements to the page. It also, by default, reverts you to the 8/8/12 layout, though it can be commented out). This was the first of three revamps. The first two contained an image which was a slightly modified version of the one found on the blog (the first revamp had color, and a little more depth, and the second was rearranged slightly with the same layout, and less depth because of a lack of color), and the last one is the version currently in use.
