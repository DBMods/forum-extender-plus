##Script Variations
There are two variations of the script. There's a simple stable version, which only includes features that have been thoroughly tested. There's also a beta version, labeled as 'beta_included,' which includes beta features that might not be fully stable, an could cause rendering issues. The beta version will also include stable versions, in between development cycles.

##How to Install
To install the script, simply download the ZIP, and install the user.js file of your choice as a Greasemonkey plugin just like you would any other. Alternately, you can copy and paste the source or use the RAW link to the file.
