When editing these files, please do not remove the require statements for db-login.php. This file is a "config" file of sorts that connects to the database. This allows the rest of the code to be posted here without revealing database information.

Also, ```\css``` and ```\js``` contain CSS and JavaScript for the system. ```\css\raw``` and ```\js\raw``` contain the original, minified source from online resources. When editing, please edit the files outside of the ```\raw``` directories.

*Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica. Ergo draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica adjuramus te. Cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque aeternae perditionis venenum propinare.*

In all seriousness, though, this code needs to be completely rewritten. It works for the most part, but in the backend, this code is a mess (read: ugly spaghetti code). The plan is to use the same UI design we currently have, but scrap the entire backend.

It's a thing in progress. Respect the thing!
