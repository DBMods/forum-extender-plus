When editing these files, please do not remove the require statements for db-login.php. This file is a "config" file of sorts that connects to the database. This allows the rest of the code to be posted here without revealing database information.

Also, ```\css``` and ```\js``` contain CSS and JavaScript for the system. ```\css\raw``` and ```\js\raw``` contain the original, minified source from online resources. When editing, please edit the files outside of the ```\raw``` directories.
