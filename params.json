This can greatly increase productivity and speed when handling forum replies, which is especially good for forum Super Users and regulars.\r\n\r\n##The Backstory\r\nThe script started as a joke between the Super Users. It all started in [this forum thread](https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=64314), and we've always said how it would be cool if we had icons, and this script did exactly that: added icons. Animated Nyan Cat icons to be exact.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
